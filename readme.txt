== Frequently Asked Questions ==

See our [Documentation](http://recipress.com/docs) for more information.

= Q: How quickly does the plugin work? =
**A:** The plugin will automatically add some cuisines, courses, skill levels, and ingredients so that you can start adding recipes right away.

= Q: Can I edit the Cuisines, Courses, Skill Levels, and Ingredients? =
**A:** Yes! You can find the management pages in the ReciPress menu. They work just like post tags and categories.

= Q: Can I output ReciPress term lists without using a widget? =
**A:** Yes! Use the template tag `recipress_terms($taxonomy, $args)`. The `$args` variable accepts the same attributs as [`get_terms()`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_terms). **Note:** This only supports a list output, not a cloud.

= Q: Can I output recent Recipes without using a widget? =
**A:** Yes! Use the template tag `recipress_recent($num , $image)`. 
* `$num` should be set to the number of posts you want to output and is set to 5 if ommitted.
* `$image` should be set for displaying an image(1) thumbnail in the list or not(0) ans is set to 1 by default.

= Q: Can I request a feature or report a bug? =
**A:** Yes please! I have big plans for this recipe to keep developing it into a multifaceted solution for food and recipe bloggers. [ReciPress.com](http://www.recipress.com) will have a support forum, upgraded support for "Pro" customers, and even custom themes and add-ons! It is my goal to offer a fully supported solution and I would love your feedback on what features seem broken, incomplete, uneccessary, or missing. Until I open the official support forum, please use the forums here and tag your posts with "ReciPress".
